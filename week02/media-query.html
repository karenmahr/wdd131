            <h2>Mosiah 2:4</h2>
            <p>And also that they might give thanks to the Lord their God, who had brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, and who
            had delivered them out of the hands of their enemies, and had appointed just men to be their teachers, and also a just
            man to be their king, who had established peace in the land of Zarahemla, and who had taught them to keep the
            commandments of God, that they might rejoice and be filled with love towards God and all men.</p>
